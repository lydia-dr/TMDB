**TMDB Project**

Programmatic Data Wrangling Project for the _Digital Futures Academy_.  It was a project conducted in a day, including the notebook itself and presentation of key insights.

The aim of the project was to load, clean, analyse, and visualise the data in The Movie Data Base, in order to practise the EDA and data wrangling skills learned during the Academy. 

Insights were drawn on the correlation between movie budget and revenue generated, looking at comparisons between mean revenue and total revenue, and the nuances in this relationship were explored.

There are two folders:

- Code: Contains one file of python code, detailing the entire EDA process.
- Data: Contains one .csv file on TMBD.
